# Issue Tracker Reconciliation
## Updated: 2026-02-24

---

## Objective

Align GitHub issue status with repository status docs and launch-critical scope.

---

## Proposed Labels/Milestones

- Milestone: `Launch-Critical Closeout`
- Milestone: `Post-Launch Backend Phase`
- Label: `done-awaiting-close`
- Label: `launch-critical`
- Label: `post-launch`
- Label: `manual-external`

---

## Reconciliation Checklist

1. Close issues already completed in code/docs.
2. Move manual external tasks (GSC/Bing) under `launch-critical` + `manual-external`.
3. Move backend architecture/implementation issues to `post-launch`.
4. Ensure issue count in tracker matches `LAUNCH-CRITICAL-STATUS.md`.

## Execution Notes

- This repo does not contain GitHub credentials; closure/retagging is manual.
- Record final issue IDs and states here after update.
