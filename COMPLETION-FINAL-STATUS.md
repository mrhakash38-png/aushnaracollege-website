# Completion Final Status (Aligned)
## Updated: 2026-02-24

---

## Current Verdict

- The website is **core-feature complete** for frontend content and SEO baseline.
- The project is **not fully complete end-to-end** because launch-critical operations are still pending.

For canonical tracking, see: `LAUNCH-CRITICAL-STATUS.md`.

---

## Completed

- Public website pages are implemented and routed.
- SEO baseline is implemented (meta tags, canonical URLs, sitemap, robots, schema).
- Build and monitoring scripts are present.

---

## Pending (Launch-Critical)

1. Google Search Console verification + sitemap submission
2. Bing Webmaster verification + sitemap submission
3. HSTS enabled and verified in production checks
4. Contact mode decision documented and validated
5. Issue tracker reconciliation and milestone alignment
6. Real-device mobile smoke test evidence

---

## Scope Clarification

- Backend platform implementation remains a separate future phase.
- This report supersedes earlier "100% complete" language.
